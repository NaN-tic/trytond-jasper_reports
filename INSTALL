Installing trytond_jasper_reports
=================================

Prerequisites
-------------

 * Python 2.5 or later (http://www.python.org/)
 * trytond (http://www.tryton.org/)
 * OpenJDK Runtime Environment

Installation
------------

Once you've downloaded and unpacked the trytond_jasper_reports source release, 
enter the directory where the archive was unpacked, and run:

    python setup.py install

Note that you may need administrator/root privileges for this step, as
this command will by default attempt to install module to the Python
site-packages directory on your system.

For advanced options, please refer to the easy_install and/or the distutils
documentation:

To use without installation, extract the archive into ``trytond/modules`` with
the directory name jasper_reports.

 * jasperport. Default 8090

 * jasperpid. Default tryton-jasper.pid
